Merp is a role playing game on paper, that means there are players
and a game master. The actions in-game involve a lookup in tables that has
the benefit of making the results far more realistics than with a simple
offensive/defensive bonus and a dice draw but has a drawback, that is the time
and focusing energy needed to read through the tables on any action.
With this helper you can avoid most of that:
Fights: setting parameters followed by a button press yields the dealt damage and level of critic, need to lookup critics in the book.
Dynamic actions: yields the corresponding number on the table, need to lookup dynamic action's fails. 
Travels: all travel mechanism is included, you press 'travel' with the options (like density of population etc...) and the traveled distance is updated alongside the encounters symbols.
Resistance draw: For resisting spells, the table is included and yields a 'resist/resists not'.

As it is you will be interested mostly in the travel and fight mechanism.
