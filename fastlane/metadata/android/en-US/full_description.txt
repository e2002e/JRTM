The app processes the game parameters throught the tables, and releases the GM
from loss of time while doing calcultations and lookups.
There is the fighting system, you still have to keep the order of the rounds
and tracks of the characters yourself. If some option or result button is grayed,
it means it's not possible according to the weapon type/distance.
Travels are made easy, the symbols are like in the french book:
./. before the slash means civilized creatures, after it stands for wildings.
- nothing
v seen
r encounter
h hostile
a attacks
p ambush
The app doesn't exempt the game master from consulting the tables
that include a full description like critics and blunders (noted M).
The syntax of the description of the effect whether it be a spell, a weapon,
or an attack from a creature: FirstCritic(Max) SecondCritic(Max, condition) Miss((MissCritic(Max))
Max).
There is a Remainder tab for which I doubt the French edition's page number
corresponds with the English one.
